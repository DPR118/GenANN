# GenANN
Classes to support easy Evolutionary Training of any arbitrary ANN. Supports Ensemble learning and Muti-objective Optimization in that context


The RunMe file will run all other necessary files to recreate experiments from GMEANNs paper. To modify the system for any arbitrary use, refer to the documentation of the GMEANNs class and the GenANN class.
